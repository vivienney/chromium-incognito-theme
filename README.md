# Chromium Incognito Theme

This is a flat theme inspired by Chromium incognito dark theme.

Incognito mode currently uses a dark colour scheme to distinguish it from normal mode. This theme replicates that colour scheme and applies it throughout the whole browser while keeping the overall look flat.

### Installation
Download the repository. Enable developer mode under chrome://extensions/. Unpack and install.

### Github
This theme is fully open-source under the Apache License. Forked from [Fiddle-N](https://github.com/Fiddle-N/material-incognito-dark-theme/).
